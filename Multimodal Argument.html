            Is the News Creating Unneccesary Panic with the Weather?
        </header>
        
        <p><!--Introduction-->
            Millions of people in the US live within areas that are considered to be prone to extreme weather. Whether this includes the large and powerful hurricanes, 
            or on a smaller but potentially stronger scale, tornadoes, these people rely on the news in order to know when they should be prepared. While the news is an important
            source of this information, it can be frustrating for many when you prepare for a "once in a lifetime" storm, and... nothing. It can feel like the news is almost
            misleading at times, but you have to ask yourself: "was I just lucky, or is the news hyping it up for attention?" It's very important for the news to be accurate and 
            truthful since this can impact your life and potentially create lots of anxiety or fear in an approaching storm. In order to get to the bottom of this, let's take a 
            look at some recent severe weather events, and determine if the news is potentially creating extra fear for attention, or not.

        <div class="block"> <!--warnings leading up to tornado outbreak-->
            <div class="text">April 25-28 Tornado Outbreak <br> This tornado outbreak occurred throughout the plains affecting many people. While there was some warning
            to this event occurring, there wasn't as much as say a hurricane. While a hurricane can be tracked usually up to a week in advance, tornadoes let alone an outbreak
            of can not. It is very hard to tell what the scale of the event will be until it occurs. Prior to the outbreak, there was an enhanced risk of severe weather issued,
            which included an increased risk of EF2 or stronger tornadoes forming<sup><a href='#source1' id="ref1">1</a></sup>. The amount of coverage on this would mostly be on local channels in the areas of concern. 
            So the amount of people viewing this was smaller since it wasn't broadcasted widespread<sup><a href='#source2' id="ref2">2</a></sup>. 
            There was adequate coverage to prevent risk of injury or death from the weather, but it also wasn't largescale news like how hurricanes are covered.</div>

        <div class="block"><!--why lower amounts of coverage can be good(2011 outbreak panic)-->
            <div class="text">May 19-27 Tornado Outbreak <br> This sequence of severe weather outbreaks also occurred throughout the plains and produced over
            240 tornadoes. While this event is similar to the April 25-28 outbreak, it had higher risk levels issued, level 4 out of 5s (Moderate Risk), and had talks of
            tornado outbreaks occurring before they happened. Now there wasn't an extreme amount of coverage like hurricanes, but there was just enough to warn and prepare
            individuals within the risk areas. Local news networks do cover the increased risk of severe weather, but it isn't something you'll see as widespread as hurricanes. This can 
            actually be somewhat beneficial in preventing a sense of panic. When people hear the term "tornado outbreak" they immediately think of past events
            like the 2011 Super Outbreak and all the devastation with them. This is why when news channels are forecasting a high risk day, they avoid using that terminology,
            especially since very little could potentially happen. There have been times where a high risk of severe weather had been issued, but the amount of weather that occurred
            was nowhere close to what was predicted. Getting this wrong could cause backlash, especially if people were anxious about the upcoming event<sup><a href='#source3' id="ref3">3</a></sup>.</div>

        <div class="block"> <!--importance of coverage-->
            <div class="text">Hurricane Helene <br> On September 24, a storm formed within the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Storm Helene. Only two days later
            the storm would form not only into a hurricane, but a category 4 one. On the evening of September 26 it made landfall within the big bend of Florida and would
            travel north-eastward affecting millions of people. As it headed into land, there were news headlines describing catastrophic rainfall coming<sup><a href='#source4' id="ref4">4</a></sup>, and unfortunately
            it was very accurate for a lot of the regions impacted. Some of the regions impacted aren't even considered to be "hurricane prone" which caught some people off guard
            from how far inland it traveled. Damages from the storm are estimated to be $200 billion with many lives taken. With this happening, this shows how important 
            a wider spread of coverage can be, since it will make a larger number of people aware of what is to come.</div>

        <div class="block"><!--misinformation with strength of storms from strong headlines-->
            <div class="text">Hurricane Milton <br> This storm had intense headlines when it was at its peak. While it initially formed on October 5, two days later it quickly
            intensified into a strong category 5. When this occurred there were tons of news headlines covering the incredibly strong and dangerous hurricane Milton.
            Though with what it did, there was a little bit of confusion with it. News headlines lead to many people believing it would make 
            landfall at that level and absolutely devastate Florida. But that isn't what happened, or was even predicted to happen. While there was some debate on the final
            strength and location of landfall of the hurricane, it was pretty clear it was going to weaken prior to making landfall<sup><a href='#source5' id="ref5">5</a></sup>. Estimates at the time were between category 2
            and category 3. While this is still reason to take action and prepare for it, it wasn't the destructive force it was while it was soaking in the Gulf of Mexico. 
            This caused people to have some distaste or confusion with the media since they were expecting significantly more. 
            There was also the fact that it was initially believed to hit Tampa Florida in such a way that it could have a devastating record storm surge of 15 ft in 
            Tampa Bay<sup><a href='#source6' id="ref6">6</a></sup>. While this was initially a true fear, as the storm approached and weakened it became more clear it was actually going to head further South
            with a still destructive 10 ft of storm surge in areas<sup><a href='#source7' id="ref7">7</a></sup>.</div>

            Conclusions
        </header>
        <p>
            In conclusion, it is very important that news media broadcasts upcoming weather events due to how they could impact people's lives in a major way. While the news
            does do a good job in ensuring the general public is informed and getting prepared, there is some misguidance with their headlines. While the headlines were less
            extreme with upcoming tornado threats, it seems that there are some hyperbolic in nature headlines being used. As it was found it seems that stations like to use
            headlines pointing out the extremes of the storm, even if those extremes wouldn't still occur once the storm finally approaches. It is important for headlines to be
            more accurate for what is to come, to prevent losing trust of people reading the headlines, but also contain some urgency to ensure people follow proper safety procedures.
